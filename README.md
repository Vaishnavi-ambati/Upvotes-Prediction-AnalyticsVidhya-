1. In the first notebook file following tasks are performed:
    * Understanding the data
    * Finding outliers 
    * Finding required columns
    * Null values check
    * Skweness check
    * Handling categorical variables
    * Trained the model using different Regression algorithms
    * Used GradientBoostingRegressor and RandomForestRegressor to predict the values for Test data.
    * Reduced skewness
    * Used RandomForestRegressor after reducing skewness to predict the values for Test data.
    * Observed the correlation between the independent columns and independent columns with target column.
